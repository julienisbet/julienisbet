## Hi, I'm Julie 👋
Former IC and teacher, now EM, I build teams that ship great products without burning out humans

## Currently
- Thinking about how AI / agentic coding changes how we do code review
- Building a project tracker that does all the things I wish Jira did without all the extra crap I don't need
- Wondering if there's going to be a great bug apocalypse in 2027 when the vibe code breaks and Stack Overflow can’t save us

## What I optimize for
- Psychological safety
- Clear communication (even when it's uncomfy)
- Sustainable delivery

## About me
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- 🌇 Live in NYC
- ⚡ Fun fact: My dog is named after a mountain in Scotland

## Dog Tax
